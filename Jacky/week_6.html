                <h2># Response to feedback</h2><br>
                <p>In response to the user feedback that i got, ive decided to completely recreate the hi-fi mock up.
                    I did this because there were some changes that i would like to make to the overall mock up, that
                    would take too long for me to create/change. </p>
                
                <p>In the new mockup, all the comments, issues, changes proposed were considered and included in the
                    final design. I have also added a further step towards the end each “journey” that is required to
                    be there but was missing due to a lack for foresight. But now its there in the new Hi-fi Prototype.</p>

                <p>I’ve also decided to remove some elements of the register process to cut down on some features to allow
                    for the user to get to use the app as soon as possible. </p>

                <p>The process of re-creating the prototype was far more simpler because I knew how to uses Adobe XD with more
                    proficiency making this possible. If not the prototype would feel very bloated with unnecessary elements
                    that weren't used or had no purpose. </p>

                <h2># Reflection</h2>
                <p>This week was prototyping, mainly creating a hifi prototype and iterating from the lofi prototype.
                    The prototype created should follow a user journey of what the user would do if they were to use the app.</p>

                <p>So my first lofi prototype was created in adobe xd with only one user journey, the journey was of the user making a
                    trip to a destination. For the hifi prototype i had to redo the prototype because the lofi prototype was created
                    before the brand guidelines doc. This part was rather annoying as i would have wanted (in hindsight) to have the
                    brand guidelines doc created beforehand.</p>

                <p>So with creating a brand new prototype with a small amount of Adobe XD experience wasnt that hard and took about 3.5days.
                    With this new prototype ive decided to add more user journeys like, a sign up, login, going into recent recent activities
                    and profile within the app. I did this because i wanted to make a semi full app experience for the user and get lots of
                    feedback on multiple things and hope to iron out most of the kinks and wrinkles.</p>

                <p>After ive gotten the user feedback and seeing the response, my first reactions were to fully re create and hifi prototype.
                    This is because i thought that i can create a more polished prototype after have some experience in using XD. I would
                    implement feedback and make the changes while re creating the prototype.</p>
                
                <p>With the experience and feedback at hand , i re created the prototype within a day/one sitting. The outcome of that was
                    that it was better then the post feedback version which im really happy about.</p>
