                <h2># Reflection</h2><br>
                <p>This week was about creating a brand guidelines document and a promotional poster.</p>
                <p>With creating a brand guidelines document I took some inspiration from some well known brand guidelines document from well known companies,
                    such as Spotify and oculus. I really liked how did their colour, and incorrect colour use. I liked how they show all their colour choices and
                    decide to emulate them. Ive also never thought of adding incorrect colour use but when viewing the brand guidelines, i thought it would help
                    me with deciding how colour could be used in my own project. With oculus their colour palette and use of colour were amazing and i wanted to
                    emulate them but it would have taken far more effort and time then i had so i decided not to.  But one way oculus brand guideline helped me
                    so solve my problem with not complying with pages had to be in sets of 4. With my original layout i would have had 22 pages in total but after
                    looking into oculus. i saw that they had some mockups to show they branding and how it was used which i thought would be a good addition showing
                    how i would use my brand and it also fills up the last 2 pages. </p>
                
                <p>With creating the poster i wanted to create something that includes the teleport pads linking to each other over a map. But upon creating more
                    ideas on the poster, i thought of how i could shake up this concept a little bit. This is because the map i created looked like the low effort
                    DiDi ads(taxi, similar to uber) and i didnt want my brand to seem low effort so i choose not to follow through and leave it as a digital concept.
                    i moved to removing the map to have random lines moving out of a telepad in the center with times showing time take for each trip and if the area
                    is busy, slightly busy, or average.</p>
