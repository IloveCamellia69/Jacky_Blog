                        <p>Everyday Cassidy has to get up and go to work very early in the morning because she works far away from her
                        workplace and also has to deal with traffic. Not to mention she also has to take care of her kids along side
                        her husband that also has to get up early for work. This doesn't give Cassidy any time for herself as she has
                        to wake up early and come home late and still has to cook for her family. </p> <br>

                        <p>She wishes that there was a better way to get to her workplace that doesn't take as long and doesn't have
                        to be stuck in traffic so that should could get some time with her family and herself.</p><br>

                <h2># Updated User Journey</h2><br>
                <p>During the school holiday’s, Cassidy and her family went to a tech convention where they showcased some of the newest tech
                    start ups and products that is being release in the “near future”. While at this convention they came across a start up
                    called Port. They Advertised themselves as a transport company using the technology of teleportation to move people from
                    place to place using portals and checkpoints. This caught the interest of Cassidy and her family as they live a decent
                    distance away from work and school. While looking around the Port booth, an assistant came up to them and asked if they
                    would like to join the beta as he overheard the family talking about how useful it would be for them. With excitement and
                    caution the family agreed to join the beta. After signing a contract as beta testers and early adopter they left and went
                    to see other booths.</p>
                <p>After waiting a few weeks and seeing Port all over the news and social media, the families excitement continues to grow higher
                    and higher. The day finally came when the receive a package from Port. The package contained 4 phones for each family member.
                    As they unboxed the phones they were greeted when opening the Port app on the phone a welcome to the Beta message and prompting
                    them to sign in with the credentials provided by port. After entering the credentials they were prompted to create their own
                    account as the credentials provided was to confirm their position as Beta tester/early adopters. They were prompted to enter
                    they name, email, phone number, and a new password.</p>
                <p>Once the account was created they were taken to the home page of the app welcoming them into Port. They were also prompted to
                    test out the service, they were prompted to find a checkpoint near their home so they can get back, then another checkpoint
                    somewhere else to teleport to. And so they did.</p>

                        <p>This would be the rough prototype for the checkpoints that people would be teleporting to.
                            This would be the idea shape of a small platform so the checkpoint doesnt take up a lot of
                            space allowing for quick placement and maintenance. The design of the checkpoint is pretty
                            much set in stone and i dont want to change unless its for engineering requirements.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The flow of the UI</li>
                    <li>The layout of the UI elements</li>

                    <li>The General feel of the app </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Who i tested on:</h3>
                <p>I have tested this UI on some of the classmates in the room and online friends</p>
                <h3>What i found out:</h3>
                <p>I have found out that i may need to updated the flow of the UI with a comment from one of the tester
                    saying “how will you make money from this, and this looks somewhat similar to the UI of Uber”.
                    This made me think about how i would need to add another step asking for payment of X amount.
                    Another tester said that the recent activity and profile tabs need to be created as those menus
                    are very important for users for usability and ease of use of the app, a settings menu should
                    also be added. Although this is a lo-fi prototype i feel that this feed back is useful when putting
                    time and effort into creating the Hi-fi prototype for a full user experience. Some other feedback was
                    not helpful with further improving the UI and UX and have been left out.</p>
