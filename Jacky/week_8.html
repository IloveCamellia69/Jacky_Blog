                <h2># New Brand story</h2><br>
                <p>It started off with me being late class back in Highschool where the travel time was very long and traffic, atrocious even by car. Better yet,
                    sometimes I would have to beg my teacher to see if I can leave the class early just so that I can make it to the bus to get home before it
                    leaves 10 minutes after school ended. </p>
                <p>Being late was still a thing a thing when I was in university. Either it was the busses no coming or canceled or traffic, or sometimes even both.
                    I’ve nearly had enough of being late several times a week, it was just tiring to deal with. </p>
                <p>But when portals and teleportation was discovered, everything for me changed. Knowing that I was top  in the field of quantum tunnels in my university
                    class, I knew I had to do something. After finishing my masters weeks after the discovery I immediately applied to the company that discovered it.
                    I was accepted in. A few years have gone by, learnt more things then I could ever dream of.  An opportunity arose when the company wanted to
                    create a subsidiary focusing on travel and how this new technology could be utilized. With years under my belt, I was appointed head.</p>
                <p>And that’s how port was created.</p>
                <p>Now port is in the small testing phase or our project and ironing things out. We currently have around a few hundred beta tester including our staff
                    member located in Auckland New Zealand helping us improve our service.</p>
                <p>More is yet to come from Port and everyone else.</p>

                <p>We use our quantum tunneling technology and special quantum computers to spawn portals where you want and when you want. Then our servers link the portal
                    to the selected destination that you have selected and initializes a connection with your phone, portal, then the destination to do final checks. Finally,
                    the portal is set and ready for you to walk through.</p>
