                <h2># Reflection</h2><br>
                <p>This week went ok despite some annoyances and confusion around the task for the week. Overall it was sub-par. What's worse was this entire summative
                    is a total mess throwing me left and right. It feels as if and I feel the truth was that this was rushed and somewhat shoehorned. I felt that the
                    order that we are doing things in aren't what they should be. I’m also not that happy with this week as well because creating advertisements via
                    what SEEMS like filming isn't really my thing and I’m not really looking forward to the production of the ad. Also this would have been far better
                    if it was a team doing this summative because creating a start up isn’t fully a one man job.</p>
