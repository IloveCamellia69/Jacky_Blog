                            <p>Birth: 3rd June 1990 <br>
                            Occupation: Head of HR <br>
                            Status: Married, Mother of 2</p><br>
    
                            <p>Everyday Cassidy has to get up and go to work very early in the morning because she works far away from her
                            workplace and also has to deal with traffic. Not to mention she also has to take care of her kids along side
                            her husband that also has to get up early for work. This doesn’t give Cassidy any time for herself as she has
                            to wake up early and come home late and still has to cook for her family. </p> <br>
    
                            <p>She wishes that there was a better way to get to her workplace that doesn’t take as long and doesn’t have
                            to be stuck in traffic so that should could get some time with her family and herself.</p><br>
