                    <p>Most if not all of us have commuted/traveled somewhere before haven't we? Whether it was to work or school or even shopping or just going somewhere in general.
                    And we've all been stuck in traffic jams, long rides taking to places we wish to be there in an instant. The agonizing time we have to wait for us to finally arrive,
                    the time wasted that we could have been using to get our days over with or to have plenty of fun. </p>

                    <p>But here I propose a solution. Port. Port is a transport service that allows you to travel to specified locations within seconds if not, in an instant. To use Port,
                    youll have to download the Port app on your Port compatible phone and create an account to start Porting to almost anywhere, at any time.</p>

                        <p>Birth: 3rd June 1990 <br>
                        Occupation: Head of HR <br>
                        Status: Married, Mother of 2</p><br>

                        <p>Everyday Cassidy has to get up and go to work very early in the morning because she works far away from her
                        workplace and also has to deal with traffic. Not to mention she also has to take care of her kids along side
                        her husband that also has to get up early for work. This doesn’t give Cassidy any time for herself as she has
                        to wake up early and come home late and still has to cook for her family. </p> <br>

                        <p>She wishes that there was a better way to get to her workplace that doesn’t take as long and doesn’t have
                        to be stuck in traffic so that should could get some time with her family and herself. </p><br>

                    <h2># User Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        Cassidy wakes up in the morning at 5:30am to make breakfast for her family and getting ready for work.
                        Her husband wakes up 30mins later to help out with making breakfast. Once breakfast is finished at 6:30am
                        Cassidy leaves for work. She doesnt start work until 8am, but she get stuck in traffic and is late for work
                        and she gets called out. The rest of the day doesnt get much better as the traffic soured her mood for the
                        rest of the day and wishes that there wasnt traffic so that she could have gotten to work on time. After a
                        long day and drive home she makes dinner for her family then takes a shower after dinner. Only with a little
                        time left before bed time she checks her email and see a new email from a company they she hadnt seen in years.
                        The Email was an invite to a beta test from a company called port. Port is a transport company that uses the
                        technology of teleportation to move people from place to place. The email noted that the beta starts on 12:00am
                        next Monday. With much glee Cassidy jumps with excitement and joy to have been able to get into the beta and
                        being able to use teleportation to get to work. A week later Cassidy gets a email from port prompting her to
                        install the port app on her phone. She drops everything that she is doing and instantly installs the app and
                        starts the set up in the app. The app prompts her to create an account and enter the early adopter/beta key.
                        The app asks her for her permissions for location and some personal into for the account setup. The app asks
                        for the location she wants to go however like bus stops there are only set locations that are set to prevent
                        people going to places theat they dont need to be. She picks the location thats closest to her work. Then the
                        apps askes where she would like to open a portal to go to set location. Using the camera she points it as an
                        empty wall and clicks open port. A portal shows up leading to the checkpoint that she selected. She slowly
                        walks through and arrives at the specified checkpoint, She jumps with excitement and glee.
