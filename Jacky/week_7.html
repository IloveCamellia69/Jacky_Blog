                <h2># The New Idea</h2>

                <p>Ive decided to completely make a new video idea as the first idea would take a bit longer to film and get ready.
                    Its also changed because the original idea didnt explain what my product did, how it functioned, or what its
                    purpose was in the first place.</p>

                <p>With this new idea that i came up with on Tuesday night, it told a story of someone being late within the first
                    part of the video then moving onto explaining now my app works and a blanket statement on how my service would function.</p>

                <p>Since there is little time given to make this new video i had to forego some steps and deciding that it would be better if
                    i finish the video first before completing the steps that were foregone.</p>

                <h2># Reflection</h2><br>

                <p>This week felt like a mess due to the seemingly big workload at the start of the week being only given
                    about 2 days for each video and animated logo. Despite this, it was a reasonable time given depending
                    on which route and style of video you wanted to do. </p>

                <p>Ive decided to completely make a new video idea as the first idea would take a bit longer to film and get ready.
                    Its also changed because the original idea didnt explain what my product did, how it functioned, or what its
                    purpose was in the first place.</p>

                <p>With this new idea that i came up with on Tuesday night, it told a story of someone being late within the first
                    part of the video then moving onto explaining now my app works and a blanket statement on how my service would function.</p>

                <p>Since there is little time given to make this new video i had to forego some steps and deciding that it would be better if
                    i finish the video first before completing the steps that were foregone.</p>

                <p>For the animated logo ive decided that i wanted to do a write on effect to reveal my logo before hand. This is because i
                    think that this is a somewhat professional amination and presents itself as simple and friendly. Another reason on why
                    i did this effect is because it was just simple.</p>
                
                <p>The “o” changing into my symbol was also a good idea that i had because i can merge my icon into and “o” and then split
                    them up forming the icon. The final animation turned out pretty good and i like it.</p>
